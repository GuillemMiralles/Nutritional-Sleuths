  <h1>üå≥ Estimation through Non-Destructive Analysis of the Nutritional Levels of Citrus Leaves üçä</h1>

  <h2>üìù Abstract </h2>

  <p>One of the characteristics that all living beings share is that adequate nutrition has a positive impact on our
      health. In the case of trees, and more specifically in the case of citrus trees, adequate nutrition is essential
      for the tree to be resistant to pests and diseases, produce food of the highest possible quality and quantity,
      and grow in a healthy way. Therefore, adequate nutrition is a key issue for any farmer.</p>
      
  <p>Currently, this is mainly
      achieved through the use of fertilizers or manure. However, the excessive use of these products can be harmful to
      the environment and represent a waste of resources for farmers.In other words, it is not easy to know the amount
      and type of fertilizer that each tree needs. To do this, it is necessary to identify the nutrients that are
      missing and to what extent. Currently, to accurately determine the nutritional levels of a tree, destructive
      analyses of the leaves or soil are used, which represents a significant economic and temporal cost. </p>
      
  <p>In this study,
      hyperspectral images of near-infrared and visible light (Vis-NIR) and machine learning regression models were used
      to estimate primary macronutrients (N, P, and K), secondary macronutrients (Ca, Mg, S), and micronutrients (Na,
      Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, B, and Mo). The methodology involved the application of various machine learning regression
      models and data preprocessing and dimensionality reduction techniques to determine the optimal combination. The
      results have been particularly satisfactory in estimating macronutrients, especially in the case of nitrogen (N),
      as well as potassium (K) and sulfur (S). Micronutrients have presented a greater challenge, although promising
      results have been achieved for manganese (Mn), copper (Cu), and boron (B).</p>

  <h2>📝 Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Hello there! Welcome to the "Estimation through Non-Destructive Analysis of the Nutritional Levels of Citrus Leaves"
    project! 🌿🔬
  </p>

  <p>
This is my Bachelor's Thesis, titled 'Estimation of Nutritional Levels of Citrus Leaves through Non-Destructive Analysis Using Machine and Deep Learning Techniques.' It has been an incredible journey of research and exploration, and obtaining a score of 9.7 fills me with immense pride. 🏅 I firmly believe in the potential of this work to bring significant social value by revolutionizing the way we monitor and manage citrus tree health. 🌳🍃
  </p>

  <p>
The main focus of this project is to estimate the nutritional levels of citrus trees 🍊 using hyperspectral images generated by their leaves. By leveraging cutting-edge Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques, we have developed a non-destructive approach that allows us to gain valuable insights into the health and nutrient status of these vital plants without causing any harm. 🛠️💻

  <p>
This project was done in collaboration with the Instituto Valenciano de Investigaciones Agrarias (IVIA) 🤝

  <p>
I believe that open knowledge-sharing can foster innovation and progress, which is why I am thrilled to share this work with the wider community. I hope it inspires others and sparks fruitful collaborations in the field of agriculture and beyond. 🌱🌍

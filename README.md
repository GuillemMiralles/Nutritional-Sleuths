  <h1>🌳 Estimation through Non-Destructive Analysis of the Nutritional Levels of Citrus Leaves 🍊</h1>

  <h2>📝 Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Welcome to the "Estimation through Non-Destructive Analysis of the Nutritional Levels of Citrus Leaves" project!
    🌿🔬 This project aims to estimate the nutritional levels of citrus trees 🌳 using hyperspectral images generated by
    their leaves. We apply cutting-edge Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques to achieve accurate and
    non-invasive estimations, enabling better monitoring and management of citrus tree health. 🍃🌱
